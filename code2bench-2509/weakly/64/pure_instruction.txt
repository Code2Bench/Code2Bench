"""Parse a response string in the format `<answer>...</answer>` and extract relevant information.

The function processes a response string that is expected to follow the format `<answer>...</answer>`. It extracts the content within the `<answer>` tag, removes any special tokens if provided, and splits the content into a list of actions based on a specified separator. The function also checks if the response strictly follows the expected format.

Args:
    response (str): The response string to be parsed.
    special_token_list (List[str], optional): A list of special tokens to remove from the action content. Defaults to None.
    action_sep (str, optional): The separator used to split the action content into individual actions. Defaults to ','.
    max_actions (int, optional): The maximum number of actions to extract from the action content. Defaults to 3.

Returns:
    Dict: A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - llm_raw_response: The original response string.
        - llm_response: The response string with the `<answer>` tag.
        - think_content: An empty string (no think content in this format).
        - action_content: The content extracted from the `<answer>` tag.
        - actions: A list of actions extracted from the action content.
        - format_correct: A boolean indicating whether the response strictly follows the expected format.
