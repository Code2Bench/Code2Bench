"""Fix common text encoding issues and decode escaped sequences.

This function handles two primary text encoding issues:
1. Fixes UTF-8 characters incorrectly displayed as Windows-1252/latin-1 (e.g., 'â' -> '’').
2. Decodes backslash-escaped unicode sequences (e.g., '\\u2019' -> '’').

Non-string inputs are returned unchanged. The function attempts to fix mojibake only if typical mojibake markers (e.g., 'â€', 'Ã', 'Â') are present in the text. If decoding fails at any step, the original text is preserved.
"""
