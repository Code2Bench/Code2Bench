"""Normalizes a given string by removing diacritics, normalizing quotes and dashes, removing citations, details in parentheses, and outermost quotation marks, and collapsing whitespaces.

The function processes the input string in multiple steps:
1. Decodes the input to UTF-8 if it is not already a string.
2. Removes diacritics using Unicode normalization.
3. Normalizes various types of quotes and dashes to standard characters.
4. Iteratively removes citations, details in parentheses, and outermost quotation marks until no further changes occur.
5. Removes a final period if present.
6. Collapses multiple whitespaces into a single space and converts the string to lowercase.

Args:
    x (str or bytes): The input string or byte sequence to be normalized.

Returns:
    str: The normalized string in lowercase with all specified transformations applied.
