"""Parses a JSON string or a Python literal string into a Python object.

This function attempts to parse the input string first as JSON. If that fails, it tries to parse it as a Python literal using `ast.literal_eval`. If both attempts fail, the original string is returned along with a boolean indicating the parsing failure.

Args:
    json_value (str): The string to be parsed, which can be a JSON string or a Python literal string.

Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the parsed Python object (or the original string if parsing fails) and a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful (True if successful, False otherwise).
