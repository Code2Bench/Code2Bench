"""Recursively merges the 'source' dictionary into the 'destination' dictionary.

The function performs a deep merge where keys from 'source' overwrite existing keys in 'destination'.
If a key in 'source' corresponds to a dictionary, a recursive merge is performed. The 'destination'
dictionary is modified in place. If a key in 'destination' is not a dictionary, it is overwritten
entirely by the corresponding value from 'source'.

Args:
    source (Dict): The dictionary to merge into 'destination'.
    destination (Dict): The dictionary to be merged into, modified in place.

Returns:
    Dict: The modified 'destination' dictionary after merging.
"""
You should write code starting with:
from typing import Dict

def _deep_merge_dicts(source: Dict, destination: Dict) -> Dict:
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass
