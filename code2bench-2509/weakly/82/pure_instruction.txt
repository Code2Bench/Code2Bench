"""Parse tool call from action text.

This function extracts and parses a tool call from the given action text. It looks for a specific pattern
`<tool_call>...</tool_call>` in the text and attempts to parse the content within. The content is expected to
contain a tool name and parameters, which are then formatted into a structured JSON action. If the parsing fails
or the tool name is missing, the function returns the original action text and indicates the parsing was unsuccessful.

Args:
    action (str): The action text containing the tool call to be parsed.

Returns:
    Tuple[str, bool]: A tuple where the first element is the parsed action (as a JSON string) or the original
    action text if parsing fails. The second element is a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful.
