"""Helper function to transform a list of flat dictionaries into a dictionary of lists.

A "flat" dictionary is defined as a dictionary where none of the values are nested dictionaries, but instead are simple types such as numpy arrays, floats, etc.

Args:
    list_of_dict (list): A list of flat dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list must have the same set of keys.

Returns:
    dict_of_list (dict): A dictionary where each key corresponds to a list of values from the input dictionaries. The order of keys is preserved using `collections.OrderedDict`.

Raises:
    AssertionError: If the input `list_of_dict` is not a list.
"""
You should write code starting with:
import collections

def list_of_flat_dict_to_dict_of_list(list_of_dict: list) -> collections.OrderedDict:
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass
