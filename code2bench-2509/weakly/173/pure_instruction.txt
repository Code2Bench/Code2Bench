"""Smooths a depth map by applying a minimum filter.

The function processes a depth map by replacing zero values with a large constant (1e5), 
applies a minimum filter with a kernel size of 11 to smooth the depth map, and then 
restores the zero values by replacing the large constant back to zero.

Args:
    depth (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the depth map. Zero values in the 
        depth map are treated as missing or invalid data.

Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: A smoothed 2D depth map with the same shape as the input, where 
        zero values are preserved.
