"""Parses a TLV (Type-Length-Value) structure from a binary buffer.

The function extracts the type, length, and value from the buffer, and also returns the remaining buffer after the TLV structure. The buffer is expected to be in big-endian format, and the length is used to determine the value and any padding required to align to a 4-byte boundary.

Args:
    buf (bytes): A binary buffer containing the TLV structure. The buffer must be at least 4 bytes long to extract the type and length.

Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - t (int): The type extracted from the buffer.
        - l_ (int): The length of the value extracted from the buffer.
        - v (bytes): The value extracted from the buffer.
        - buf (bytes): The remaining buffer after the TLV structure and any padding.

Note:
    The function assumes the buffer is in big-endian format and that the length field is 2 bytes long.
