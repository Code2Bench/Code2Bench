"""Computes the logarithmic map of a rotation matrix in SO(3).

The logarithmic map converts a rotation matrix into a 3D vector in the Lie algebra so(3), which represents the axis-angle representation of the rotation. The function handles special cases where the rotation matrix corresponds to a 180-degree rotation.

Args:
    R (numpy.ndarray): A 3x3 rotation matrix in SO(3).

Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: A 3D vector in so(3) representing the logarithmic map of the rotation matrix.

Notes:
    - The function uses a threshold of 1e-10 to handle numerical precision issues.
    - Special cases are handled when the trace of the rotation matrix is close to -1, indicating a 180-degree rotation.
