"""Parse LLM response and extract trading decisions.

This function attempts to parse a response from a Language Learning Model (LLM) to extract trading decisions. It first tries to extract a JSON object from the response using a regular expression. If successful, it parses the JSON string into a dictionary. If no JSON object is found, it attempts to parse the entire response as JSON. If parsing fails, it returns a dictionary containing an error message and the raw response.

Args:
    response (str): The raw response string from the LLM.

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the parsed trading decisions if successful, or an error message and the raw response if parsing fails.
