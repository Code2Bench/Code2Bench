"""Given the contents of an entry-points file, process it into a 2-level dictionary.

The first level keys are entry-point groups, the second level keys are entry-point names, 
and the second level values are references to objects (that correspond to the entry-point value).

Args:
    text (str): The contents of the entry-points file.
    text_source (str, optional): The source identifier for the text. Defaults to "entry-points".

Returns:
    dict[str, dict[str, str]]: A 2-level dictionary where the first level keys are entry-point groups,
    the second level keys are entry-point names, and the second level values are references to objects.
