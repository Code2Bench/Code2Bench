def sanitize_html(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Sanitizes HTML content by removing HTML tags, decoding HTML entities, and escaping problematic characters to ensure the text is safe for MDX parsing.

    This function performs the following operations:
    1. Removes HTML tags using regex.
    2. Decodes HTML entities.
    3. Handles comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) by replacing them with descriptive text to avoid MDX parsing errors.
    4. Escapes standalone `<` and `>` characters to their HTML-safe equivalents (`&lt;` and `&gt;`).
    5. Escapes pipe (`|`) characters to prevent table parsing issues in MDX.
    6. Modifies JSON-like content by replacing single and double quotes with backticks and wrapping curly braces in code tags if necessary.
    7. Escapes special characters such as `$` and `%` to avoid triggering MDX parsing.
    8. Ensures the final sanitized text is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces.

    Args:
        text (str): The input string containing HTML content or text to be sanitized.

    Returns:
        str: The sanitized text that is safe for MDX parsing.
