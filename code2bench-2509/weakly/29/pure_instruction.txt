"""Parses a mobile response string into a structured dictionary.

The function extracts 'Memory', 'Reason', and 'Action' sections from the response string using a regular expression pattern. It also attempts to parse the 'Action' section as JSON if it starts with a '{'. Additionally, it removes any content within '<|begin_of_box|>' and '<|end_of_box|>' tags from the 'Action' section.

Args:
    response (str): The response string to be parsed.

Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the parsed 'memory', 'reason', 'action', and 'parsed_action' (if applicable). Returns None if the response does not match the expected pattern.
