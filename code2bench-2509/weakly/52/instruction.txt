"""Check if a requested resource URL matches a configured resource URL.

A requested resource matches if it has the same scheme, domain, port,
and its path starts with the configured resource's path. This allows
hierarchical matching where a token for a parent resource can be used
for child resources. The comparison is case-insensitive for the scheme and netloc.

Args:
    requested_resource: The resource URL being requested, as a string.
    configured_resource: The resource URL that has been configured, as a string.

Returns:
    True if the requested resource matches the configured resource, otherwise False.
"""
You should write code starting with:
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def check_resource_allowed(requested_resource: str, configured_resource: str) -> bool:
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass
