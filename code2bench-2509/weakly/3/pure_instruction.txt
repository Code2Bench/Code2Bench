"""Generates a list of shifted 720P windows based on the input size and number of windows.

The function calculates the window sizes and shifts for a given 3D size (time, height, width) and the desired number of windows. The windows are resized to fit within a 720P resolution constraint. The function ensures that the windows are non-overlapping and cover the entire input space.

Args:
    size (Tuple[int, int, int]): A tuple representing the original size in the format (time, height, width).
    num_windows (Tuple[int, int, int]): A tuple representing the desired number of windows in the format (time, height, width).

Returns:
    List[Tuple[slice, slice, slice]]: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains three slice objects representing the time, height, and width dimensions of a window.
