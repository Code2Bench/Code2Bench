"""Extracts the skew-symmetric components from a 3x3 rotation matrix.

Given a 3x3 rotation matrix `R`, this function extracts the components that form the skew-symmetric part of the matrix. The skew-symmetric components are typically used in applications involving angular velocity or cross-product operations.

Args:
    R (numpy.ndarray): A 3x3 rotation matrix from which the skew-symmetric components are extracted.

Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: A 1D array of shape (3,) containing the skew-symmetric components [R[2, 1], R[0, 2], R[1, 0]] as float64 values.
"""
You should write code starting with:
import numpy as np

def unskew(R: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass
