"""Parses Python source code from a string and extracts top-level classes, functions, and try/if blocks. It ignores methods inside classes and any blocks nested within functions.

Args:
    source_code (str): The Python source code as a string.
    file_path_for_logging (str): The path of the file being scraped, for logging purposes.

Returns:
    list: A list of strings, where each string is a source code block. The blocks include top-level functions, classes, try/except/finally blocks, and if blocks. Methods within classes and nested blocks within functions are excluded.

Note:
    - If the source code contains syntax errors or cannot be parsed, an empty list is returned, and an error message is logged.
"""
You should write code starting with:
import ast

def scrape_python_blocks(source_code: str, file_path_for_logging: str) -> list:
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass
