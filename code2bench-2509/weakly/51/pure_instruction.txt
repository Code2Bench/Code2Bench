"""Check if the authors in the data match the authors in the paper.

This function compares the list of authors from a paper with the authors in a given data dictionary. It processes both lists by removing words shorter than a specified minimum length (AUTHOR_NAME_MIN_LENGTH) and then checks if any of the processed author names from one list are contained within the other list, or vice versa. The function allows for a different number of authors in the two lists.

Args:
    authors (list[str]): A list of author names from the paper.
    data (dict): A dictionary containing a list of authors under the key "authors".

Returns:
    bool: True if any of the processed author names match between the two lists, False otherwise.
