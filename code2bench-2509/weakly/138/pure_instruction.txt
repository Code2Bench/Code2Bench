"""Removes symbols and non-spacing marks from a string.

This function normalizes the input string using the NFKC (Normalization Form KC) form, which 
canonically composes characters and replaces compatibility characters with their equivalents. 
It then removes characters that are categorized as marks (M), punctuation (P), or symbols (S) 
according to the Unicode standard, replacing them with spaces.

Args:
    s (str): The input string from which symbols and non-spacing marks are to be removed.

Returns:
    str: The cleaned string with symbols and non-spacing marks replaced by spaces.
