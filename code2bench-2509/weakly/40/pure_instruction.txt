"""Cleans the code by handling the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block.

This function processes the input code string to handle the common Python idiom `if __name__ == '__main__'`. 
If the last block in the code is an `if` statement checking `__name__ == '__main__'`, it removes the `if` condition 
and retains only the body of the `if` block. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

Args:
    code (str): The input code string to be processed.

Returns:
    str: The cleaned code string with the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block handled.

Note:
    If the code parsing fails or the last block is not an `if` statement checking `__name__ == '__main__'`, 
    the function returns the original code unchanged.
