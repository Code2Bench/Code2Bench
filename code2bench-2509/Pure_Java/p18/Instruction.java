     * Formats the given view count into a human-readable string representation.

     * - If the view count is less than 1,000, it is returned as a plain number.
     * - If the view count is between 1,000 and 999,999, it is formatted as a number with one decimal place followed by 'K' (e.g., "1.5K").
     * - If the view count is between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, it is formatted as a number with one decimal place followed by 'M' (e.g., "1.5M").
     * - If the view count is 1,000,000,000 or greater, it is formatted as a number with one decimal place followed by 'B' (e.g., "1.5B").
