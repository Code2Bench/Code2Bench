/**
 * Retrieves the storage ID from a combined storage and repository ID string. If the combined ID

 * the provided default {@code storageId} is returned.
 *
 * <p>The method splits the {@code storageAndRepositoryId} string using the colon (":") as a delimiter.
 * If the resulting array has exactly two elements, the first element is considered the storage ID
 * and is returned. If the array does not have exactly two elements, the default {@code storageId}
 * is returned.
 *
 * <p>Note: This method is currently a placeholder and is not yet implemented.
 *
 * @param storageId the default storage ID to return if the combined ID is not properly formatted.
 *                  Must not be null.
 * @param storageAndRepositoryId the combined storage and repository ID string to parse. Must not
 *                               be null.
 * @return the extracted storage ID if the combined ID is properly formatted; otherwise, the default
 *         {@code storageId}.
