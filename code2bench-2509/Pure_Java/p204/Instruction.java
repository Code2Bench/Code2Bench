     * Calculates the shortest distance between a point and a line segment defined by two endpoints.
     * The method computes the Euclidean distance from the point to the closest point on the segment.
     *
     * <p>If the segment is degenerate (i.e., both endpoints are the same), the distance is computed
     * directly between the point and the single endpoint. Otherwise, the method calculates the projection
     * of the point onto the infinite line through the endpoints and determines the closest point on the
     * segment by clamping the projection parameter {@code t} to the range [0, 1].
     *
     * @param x1 The x-coordinate of the first endpoint of the segment.
     * @param z1 The z-coordinate of the first endpoint of the segment.
     * @param x2 The x-coordinate of the second endpoint of the segment.
     * @param z2 The z-coordinate of the second endpoint of the segment.
     * @param px The x-coordinate of the point.
     * @param pz The z-coordinate of the point.
     * @return The shortest distance between the point and the segment, as a double.
