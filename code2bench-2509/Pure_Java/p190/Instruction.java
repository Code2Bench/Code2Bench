     * Computes the cube root of a given double value. The method handles three distinct cases:

     *   <li>If the input value is greater than 0.000001, the cube root is calculated using the formula
     *       {@code Math.exp(Math.log(d) / 3.0)}.</li>
     *   <li>If the input value is between -0.000001 and 0.000001 (inclusive), the method returns 0.</li>
     *   <li>If the input value is less than -0.000001, the cube root is calculated as the negative of
     *       the cube root of the absolute value of the input, using the formula
     *       {@code -Math.exp(Math.log(-d) / 3.0)}.</li>
