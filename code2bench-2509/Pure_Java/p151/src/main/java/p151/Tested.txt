     * Converts a Java class signature (in JVM internal form) to a fully qualified class name.

     * during the conversion. Additionally, any '/' characters are replaced with '.' to
     * represent package hierarchy, and '$' characters are replaced with '.' to represent
     * nested classes.
     *
     * <p>If the input signature does not match the expected format (i.e., it is null, does not
     * start with 'L', or does not end with ';'), the method returns the input unchanged.

     * @return The fully qualified class name (e.g., "java.lang.String"), or the input
     *         signature if it does not match the expected format.
