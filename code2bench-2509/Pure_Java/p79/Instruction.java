     * Calculates a clamped analog position based on the given coordinates and directional inputs.
     * The method ensures that the resulting position does not exceed a maximum distance from the
     * original position (x, y). The directional inputs (lx, ly) are scaled by 30F to determine
     * the displacement. If the squared distance of the displacement exceeds the maximum allowed
     * squared distance (30F * 30F), the displacement is scaled down proportionally to ensure it
     * remains within the limit.
     *
     * @param x The x-coordinate of the original position.
     * @param y The y-coordinate of the original position.
     * @param lx The x-component of the directional input, typically in the range [-1, 1].
     * @param ly The y-component of the directional input, typically in the range [-1, 1].
     * @return A float array containing the clamped position as [newX, newY], where newX = x + dx
     *         and newY = y + dy, with dx and dy being the clamped displacement values.
