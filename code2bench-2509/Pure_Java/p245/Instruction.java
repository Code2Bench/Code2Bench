     * Computes the Levenshtein distance between two strings. The Levenshtein distance is a measure of the

     * deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.
     *
     * <p>This method uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the distance. It iterates
     * through each character of both strings and calculates the cost of transforming one string into the other.
     *
     * @param s1 The first string to compare. Must not be null.
     * @param s2 The second string to compare. Must not be null.
     * @return The Levenshtein distance between the two strings. The value is non-negative and represents the
     *         minimum number of edits required.
     * @throws NullPointerException if either {@code s1} or {@code s2} is null.
