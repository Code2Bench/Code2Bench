     * Extracts the UTF-8 encoded length and the updated offset from a byte array starting at the specified offset.
     * The method first skips the UTF-16 length of the string if present, then reads the UTF-8 encoded length.
     * The UTF-16 length is determined by checking the most significant bit of the first byte at the offset.
     * The UTF-8 length is read similarly, with support for multi-byte lengths if the most significant bit is set.
     *
     * @param array The byte array from which to extract the UTF-8 length and offset. Must not be null and must have
     *              sufficient length to read the required bytes starting at the specified offset.
     * @param offset The starting position in the byte array to begin reading. Must be a valid index within the array.
     * @return An int array of length 2, where the first element is the updated offset after reading the UTF-8 length,
     *         and the second element is the UTF-8 encoded length of the string.
     * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the offset is invalid or the array does not contain sufficient bytes
     *         to read the UTF-16 or UTF-8 length.
