 * Placeholder method for converting a byte array representing a MAC address into a formatted MAC address string.
 * This method is currently unimplemented and serves as a placeholder for future development.
 *
 * <p>When implemented, the method is expected to convert a byte array into a MAC address string in uppercase,
 * using hyphens as separators between each byte. Each byte would be converted into two hexadecimal characters.
 *
 * @param bytes the byte array representing the MAC address. Must not be null.
 * @return the formatted MAC address string in uppercase, with hyphens as separators.
