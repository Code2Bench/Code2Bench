     * Calculates the eased value for a quintic (fifth power) ease-in-out transition.
     * This method applies a quintic easing function to interpolate between the start and end values
     * over a specified duration. The easing function accelerates at the beginning and decelerates
     * at the end, creating a smooth transition.
     *
     * @param time The current time in the transition, typically between 0 and {@code duration}.
     * @param begin The starting value of the transition.
     * @param change The total change in value over the transition (i.e., {@code end - begin}).
     * @param duration The total duration of the transition.
     * @return The eased value at the specified time, interpolated between {@code begin} and {@code begin + change}.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code duration} is less than or equal to 0.
