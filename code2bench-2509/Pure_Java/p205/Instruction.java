     * Transforms a meta decoration model based on the coordinate base mode.

     * <p>This method adjusts the meta value by applying a rotation transformation based on the
     * coordinate base mode. If the coordinate base mode is 0, the meta value is returned unchanged.
     * Otherwise, the meta value is rotated by the coordinate base mode and combined with its type
     * component to produce the transformed result.
     *
     * @param meta The meta value to transform. Must be a non-negative integer.
     * @param coordBaseMode The coordinate base mode used to determine the rotation. Must be a
     *                      non-negative integer.
     * @return The transformed meta value, which is a combination of the rotated component and the
     *         type component of the original meta value.
