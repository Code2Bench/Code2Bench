"""Extracts content and reasoning content from a list of Gemini response parts.

This function processes a list of parts, each potentially containing text and a 'thought' flag. 
It separates the text into two categories: general content and reasoning content, based on the 
presence of the 'thought' flag.

Args:
    parts (list): A list of dictionaries where each dictionary may contain 'text' and 'thought' keys.
        - 'text' (str, optional): The text content of the part.
        - 'thought' (bool, optional): A flag indicating whether the text is part of the reasoning content.

Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing two strings:
        - The first string is the concatenated general content from parts where 'thought' is False.
        - The second string is the concatenated reasoning content from parts where 'thought' is True.

Note:
    - If a part does not contain the 'text' key, it is ignored.
    - The 'thought' key is assumed to be False if not present.
