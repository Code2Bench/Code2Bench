"""Determines if the given text has properly closed quotes and brackets.

This function checks two conditions:
1. The number of single quotes (') in the text must be even, indicating that all quotes are properly closed.
   Escaped quotes (preceded by a backslash) are ignored.
2. All square brackets ([ and ]) must be properly nested and closed. This is verified using a stack-based approach.

Args:
    text (str): The input string to be checked for properly closed quotes and brackets.

Returns:
    bool: True if the text has properly closed quotes and brackets, False otherwise.

Note:
    - The function only considers single quotes (') and square brackets ([ and ]).
    - Escaped quotes (e.g., \') are not counted as quotes.
    - The function does not handle other types of quotes or brackets.

You should write code starting with:
def is_properly_closed(text: str) -> bool:
    pass
