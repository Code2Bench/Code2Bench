/**
 * Removes duplicate items from a list based on a specific key.
 *
 * This function processes a list of items, where each item is a tuple containing four elements: 
 * two integers and two tuples of integers. The function removes duplicates by considering the 
 * combination of the first and third elements of each tuple as a key. If the combination of the 
 * first and third elements has been seen before, the item is skipped. Otherwise, the item is 
 * added to the result list.
 *
 * Args:
 *     data_list (List[Tuple[int, Tuple[int, int], int, Tuple[int, int]]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple 
 *     contains four elements: two integers and two tuples of integers.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     List[Tuple[int, Tuple[int, int], int, Tuple[int, int]]]: A list of tuples with duplicates removed based 
 *     on the combination of the first and third elements of each tuple.
