"""Remove trailing JSON delimiters that can leak into assistant text.

This function is designed to clean up message strings that may have trailing JSON
delimiters due to streaming. It specifically handles cases where a message string
is immediately followed by a JSON delimiter in the stream (e.g., '"', '",', '"}', '" ]').
Internal commas within the message are preserved.

Args:
    text (str): The input string that may contain trailing JSON delimiters.

Returns:
    str: The sanitized string with trailing JSON delimiters removed. If the input
         string is empty, it is returned as is.

Examples:
    >>> sanitize_streamed_message_content('Hello, world!",')
    'Hello, world!'
    >>> sanitize_streamed_message_content('Hello, world!"}')
    'Hello, world!'
    >>> sanitize_streamed_message_content('Hello, world!" ]')
    'Hello, world!" ]'
    >>> sanitize_streamed_message_content('Hello, world!"')
    'Hello, world!'
"""
You should write code starting with:
def sanitize_streamed_message_content(text: str) -> str:
    pass
