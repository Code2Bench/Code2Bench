"""Collapses consecutive repeated lines in a list into a single line with a repetition count.

This function processes a list of strings, identifying consecutive repeated lines and 
collapsing them into a single line annotated with the number of repetitions. If a line 
is not repeated, it is added to the result as is. The function handles edge cases such 
as an empty input list gracefully.

Args:
    lines (List[str]): A list of strings where each string represents a line.

Returns:
    List[str]: A list of strings where consecutive repeated lines are collapsed into a 
    single line with a repetition count annotation.

Example:
    >>> _collapse_repeated_lines(['line1', 'line1', 'line2', 'line2', 'line2'])
    ['line1 (Repeated 2 times)', 'line2 (Repeated 3 times)']
