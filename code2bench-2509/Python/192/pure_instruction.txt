"""Formats platform-specific constraints based on the provided platform and adaptation rules.

This function generates a formatted string of constraints tailored to the specified platform. It extracts content format rules and engagement patterns from the platform adaptation dictionary and appends platform-specific constraints based on the platform type.

Args:
    platform (str): The platform for which constraints are being formatted. Expected values include 'twitter', 'linkedin', and 'blog'.
    platform_adaptation (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing content format rules and engagement patterns. The keys 'content_format_rules' and 'engagement_patterns' are expected, but optional.

Returns:
    str: A formatted string listing the constraints, each prefixed with '- '. If no constraints are found, returns '- Standard platform optimization'.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Extracts 'content_format_rules' and 'engagement_patterns' from the platform_adaptation dictionary.
2. Appends constraints based on the presence of 'character_limit' and 'optimal_length' in content_format_rules.
3. Appends constraints based on the presence of 'posting_frequency' in engagement_patterns.
4. Adds platform-specific constraints based on the value of the platform argument.
5. Returns the formatted constraints or a default message if no constraints are found.
