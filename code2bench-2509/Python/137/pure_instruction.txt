"""Helper function to safely calculate book value CAGR and return score + reasoning.

This function calculates the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of book values over a period of time. It handles various edge cases such as insufficient data, negative book values, and transitions between positive and negative values. The function returns a tuple containing a score and a descriptive message based on the calculated CAGR or specific scenarios.

Args:
    book_values (list): A list of book values over time, where the first element is the latest value and the last element is the oldest value.

Returns:
    tuple[int, str]: A tuple containing:
        - An integer score representing the quality of the book value growth:
            * 0: Low or negative growth, or insufficient data.
            * 1: Good growth (CAGR > 10%).
            * 2: Excellent growth (CAGR > 15%).
            * 3: Special case where the company improved from negative to positive book value.
        - A string message describing the reasoning behind the score.

Raises:
    None: This function does not raise any exceptions but handles edge cases gracefully.

Examples:
    >>> _calculate_book_value_cagr([100, 120, 140])
    (0, 'Book value CAGR: -15.5%')
    >>> _calculate_book_value_cagr([100, 80, 60])
    (2, 'Excellent book value CAGR: 29.1%')
    >>> _calculate_book_value_cagr([-100, 120])
    (0, 'Warning: Company declined from positive to negative book value')
    >>> _calculate_book_value_cagr([100, -120])
    (3, 'Excellent: Company improved from negative to positive book value')
