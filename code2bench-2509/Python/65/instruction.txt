"""Parse evolve blocks from source code.

This function identifies and extracts blocks of code that are marked by specific
comment delimiters. It searches for lines containing '# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START' and
'# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END' to determine the boundaries of each block. The content
between these delimiters is captured and returned along with the line numbers
indicating the start and end of each block.

Args:
    code (str): The source code containing evolve blocks. The code should be
        provided as a single string, typically read from a file or input source.

Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int, str]]: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
        - The starting line number (0-based index) of the block
        - The ending line number (0-based index) of the block
        - The content of the block as a single string, with lines joined by newline characters

The function handles multiple blocks and ignores any content outside the marked
blocks. If a block is empty (i.e., no content between start and end markers),
the block content will be an empty string.
"""
You should write code starting with:
from typing import List, Tuple

def parse_evolve_blocks(code: str) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str]]:
    pass
