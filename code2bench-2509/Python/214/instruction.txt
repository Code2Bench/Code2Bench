"""Organizes imports by category into a formatted string.

This function takes a dictionary where keys are categories and values are lists of file names. It formats these into a structured string with a header and sections for each category. The file names within each category are sorted alphabetically.

Args:
    files_by_category (Dict[str, List[str]]): A dictionary mapping categories to lists of file names. The keys are category names, and the values are lists of file names.

Returns:
    str: A formatted string with a header and sections for each category. Each section lists the file names under the corresponding category, sorted alphabetically. If the input dictionary is empty, an empty string is returned.

The output format includes:
- A header section titled "SuperClaude Framework Components".
- For each non-empty category, a section header with the category name followed by the sorted list of file names, each prefixed with '@'.
"""
