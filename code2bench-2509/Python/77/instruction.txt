"""Generates security advice based on detected vulnerabilities.

This function analyzes a list of vulnerability descriptions and provides specific
security recommendations for each detected vulnerability type. The advice is tailored
to mitigate the risks associated with common insecure services and protocols.

Args:
    vulns (List[str]): A list of strings, each describing a detected vulnerability.

Returns:
    List[str]: A list of unique security advice strings, each corresponding to a
              specific vulnerability type. The list is deduplicated to avoid
              redundant recommendations.

The function checks for the following vulnerability types and provides corresponding
advice:
    - "FTP": Recommends disabling FTP service or prohibiting anonymous login, and
             setting strong passwords.
    - "Telnet": Recommends disabling Telnet service and using SSH or other secure
                protocols as an alternative.
    - "SMB": Recommends disabling unnecessary SMB services and applying timely
             patches.
    - "远程桌面" (Remote Desktop): Recommends enabling two-factor authentication and
                                restricting access sources for remote desktop services.
