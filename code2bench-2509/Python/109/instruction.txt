"""Validates input media dimensions and frame count based on specific conditions.

This function checks if the provided height, width, and number of frames meet the required divisibility conditions. The conditions vary depending on whether frame conditioning is enabled.

Args:
    width (int): The width of the media. Must be divisible by 8.
    height (int): The height of the media. Must be divisible by 8.
    with_frame_conditioning (bool): Indicates whether frame conditioning is enabled.
    num_frames_in (int, optional): The total number of frames in the video. Must be divisible by 16 if provided. If frame conditioning is not enabled, it must also be divisible by 32.

Returns:
    Tuple[bool, str]: A tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the input is valid. The second element is a string message describing the validation result. If the input is valid, the message is `None`.

Raises:
    None: This function does not raise any exceptions.

Notes:
    - In all cases, the height and width must be divisible by 8.
    - If `num_frames_in` is provided, it must be divisible by 16.
    - If `with_frame_conditioning` is `True`, the product of height and width must be divisible by 8192.
    - If `with_frame_conditioning` is `False` and `num_frames_in` is provided, it must be divisible by 32.
"""
You should write code starting with:
from typing import Optional, Tuple

def validate_input_media(width: int, height: int, with_frame_conditioning: bool, num_frames_in: Optional[int] = None) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
    pass
