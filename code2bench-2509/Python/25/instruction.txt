/**
 * Calculates the token counts and frame IDs for a specified rank in a distributed system.
 *
 * This function determines how tokens and their corresponding frames should be distributed
 * for a given rank, ensuring an even distribution across all ranks. Any remainder tokens
 * are assigned to the first few ranks.
 *
 * Args:
 *     T (int): Total number of tokens.
 *     token_frame (int): Number of frames per token.
 *     world_size (int): Total number of ranks in the distributed system.
 *     rank (int): The rank for which to calculate the token counts and frame IDs.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     tuple: A tuple containing two lists specific to the specified rank:
 *         - List[int]: Token counts for the rank.
 *         - List[int]: Frame IDs corresponding to the token counts.
 *
 * The function calculates the total number of frames by multiplying T and token_frame.
 * It then determines the distribution of frames across ranks, ensuring an even split
 * with any remainder frames assigned to the first few ranks. For the specified rank,
 * the function calculates the appropriate token counts and their corresponding frame IDs.

You should write code starting with:
from typing import List, Tuple

def split_token_counts_and_frame_ids(T: int, token_frame: int, world_size: int, rank: int) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    pass
