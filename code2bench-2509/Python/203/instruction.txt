"""Determine the required actions based on the step number and confidence level.

This function generates a list of actions to be taken depending on the current step in a process and the confidence level of the findings. The actions are tailored to guide the analysis and decision-making process effectively.

Args:
    step_number (int): The current step in the process. If this is the first step, specific initial actions are added.
    confidence (str): The confidence level of the findings, which can be one of the following: 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'very_high', 'almost_certain', or 'certain'. Each level triggers a different set of actions.
    findings (str): The findings from the analysis. This parameter is not directly used in the function but is included for context.
    total_steps (int): The total number of steps in the process. This parameter is not directly used in the function but is included for context.
    request (Optional[Any]): An optional request object that could be used for additional context or data. This parameter is not used in the function.

Returns:
    List[str]: A list of actions to be taken based on the step number and confidence level. The actions are designed to guide the analysis, validation, and implementation phases of the process.

You should write code starting with:
from typing import List, Optional, Any
