"""Validates and extracts accelerator classifiers from a list of classifiers.

This function filters and validates accelerator classifiers from a given list of classifiers. 
Accelerator classifiers are those that start with "Environment ::". The function checks if 
the extracted accelerator classifiers are valid based on a predefined set of valid accelerators.

Args:
    classifiers (list): A list of classifier strings to be processed.

Returns:
    list: A list of valid accelerator classifiers without the "Environment :: " prefix. 
          Returns an empty list if no valid accelerator classifiers are found or if any 
          extracted classifier is invalid.

Note:
    The function is case-sensitive and expects exact matches for valid accelerators.
    The predefined set of valid accelerators includes:
    - "GPU :: NVIDIA CUDA"
    - "GPU :: AMD ROCm"
    - "GPU :: Intel Arc"
    - "NPU :: Huawei Ascend"
    - "GPU :: Apple Metal"
