"""Aligns the indentation of the first non-empty line to match the second non-empty line in a given code string.

This function processes a multi-line string and adjusts the indentation of the first non-empty line to match that of the second non-empty line. If the indentation of the first line already matches the second line, the original string is returned unchanged. If there are fewer than two non-empty lines, the original string is also returned.

Args:
    code_string (str): A multi-line string representing code or text with potential indentation.

Returns:
    str: The modified string with the first non-empty line's indentation aligned to the second non-empty line, or the original string if no changes are needed.

Note:
    - The function only processes the first two non-empty lines it encounters.
    - Lines are considered non-empty if they contain any non-whitespace characters.
    - The function preserves the original content of the lines, only modifying the indentation.
