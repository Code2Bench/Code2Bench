"""Pretty formats a time value in nanoseconds to a human-readable string.

This function converts a given time value in nanoseconds to a more readable format by
scaling it to the appropriate unit (nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, or seconds)
and formatting it with two decimal places.

Args:
    value (int): The time value in nanoseconds to be formatted.

Returns:
    str: A human-readable string representation of the time value, scaled to the
         appropriate unit and formatted to two decimal places.

The function follows these rules:
    - If the value is less than 1000, it is returned in nanoseconds (ns).
    - If the value is between 1000 and 999,999, it is converted to microseconds (us).
    - If the value is between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, it is converted to milliseconds (ms).
    - If the value is 1,000,000,000 or greater, it is converted to seconds (s).
