"""Calculates the average percentage of correct answers across three rounds for a set of queries.

This function processes a dictionary of query results, where each query has results for three rounds 
(round1, round2, round3). It counts the number of correct answers for each round across all queries, 
computes the average correctness for each round, and then calculates the overall average correctness 
across all three rounds. The result is returned as a percentage rounded to two decimal places.

Args:
    query_results (Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]): A dictionary where each key is a query identifier and 
        the value is another dictionary with keys 'round1', 'round2', 'round3' indicating the result 
        of the query in each round. The result is either 'Correct' or 'Incorrect'.

Returns:
    float: The average percentage of correct answers across all three rounds, rounded to two decimal places.

Example:
    >>> query_results = {
    ...     'query1': {'round1': 'Correct', 'round2': 'Correct', 'round3': 'Incorrect'},
    ...     'query2': {'round1': 'Incorrect', 'round2': 'Correct', 'round3': 'Correct'}
    ... }
    >>> calculate_avg_pass_at_3(query_results)
    66.67
"""
You should write code starting with:
from typing import Dict

def calculate_avg_pass_at_3(query_results: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]) -> float:
    # TODO: Implement this function based on the docstring.
    pass
