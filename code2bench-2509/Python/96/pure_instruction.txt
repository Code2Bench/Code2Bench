"""Compute the total duration from a metrics dictionary.

This function prioritizes a single wall-clock measurement if present. If not, it sums the
durations of all per-step metrics (keys ending with "_duration"). Non-numeric and boolean
values are ignored to avoid double counting and invalid data.

Args:
    metrics (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing various metrics, potentially including
        wall-clock duration and per-step durations.

Returns:
    float: The computed total duration. If a wall-clock measurement is present, it is returned
        directly. Otherwise, the sum of all valid per-step durations is returned.

Note:
    - The function ensures that only numeric values are considered for duration calculations.
    - Boolean values are explicitly ignored to prevent incorrect summation.
    - Keys not ending with "_duration" are ignored in the fallback calculation.
