"""Convert a large integer into a human-readable string with appropriate scale labels.

This function takes an integer and converts it into a more readable format by appending
a scale label (K for thousand, M for million, B for billion, T for trillion) and rounding
to two decimal places. If the number is less than 1,000, it is returned as is. Negative
numbers are also returned as is without any scaling.

Args:
    n (int): The integer to be converted.

Returns:
    str: A string representation of the number with an appropriate scale label if applicable.

Examples:
    >>> human_count(999)
    '999'
    >>> human_count(1000)
    '1.00K'
    >>> human_count(1000000)
    '1.00M'
    >>> human_count(1000000000)
    '1.00B'
    >>> human_count(1000000000000)
    '1.00T'
