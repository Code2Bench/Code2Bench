"""Validates if the word count in the given text satisfies the specified constraint.

This function checks whether the number of words in the provided text meets the constraint defined by the quantifier and the target word count `N`. The quantifier can be one of the following: "at least", "at most", or "around". For the "around" quantifier, a tolerance of Â±10% of `N` (with a minimum of 1 word) is applied to determine if the word count is within the acceptable range.

Args:
    text (str): The input text to be evaluated.
    N (int): The target word count to compare against.
    quantifier (str): The type of constraint to apply. Must be one of "at least", "at most", or "around".

Returns:
    bool: True if the word count in the text satisfies the constraint, False otherwise.

Note:
    - The function strips leading and trailing whitespace from the text before counting words.
    - For the "around" quantifier, the tolerance is calculated as the maximum of 10% of `N` or 1 word.

You should write code starting with:
def validate_word_constraint(text: str, N: int, quantifier: str) -> bool:
    # TODO: Implement this function based on the docstring.
    pass
