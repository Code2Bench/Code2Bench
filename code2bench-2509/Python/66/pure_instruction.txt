"""Calculate the Levenshtein edit distance between two code snippets.

The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into the other. This implementation uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the distance.

Args:
    code1 (str): The first code snippet to compare.
    code2 (str): The second code snippet to compare.

Returns:
    int: The edit distance between the two code snippets, representing the number of operations needed to transform `code1` into `code2`.

Note:
    - If the two code snippets are identical, the function returns 0 immediately without further computation.
    - The function uses a dynamic programming approach with a space complexity of O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of `code1` and `code2`, respectively.
