"""Convert full-width characters in a string to their half-width equivalents.

This function processes each character in the input string and converts full-width characters
(including spaces, letters, numbers, and punctuation) to their corresponding half-width characters.
The conversion is based on Unicode code points, ensuring accurate transformation.

Args:
    s (str): The input string containing full-width characters to be converted.

Returns:
    str: A new string with all full-width characters converted to half-width characters.

The function handles the following conversions:
    - Full-width space (U+3000) is converted to half-width space (U+0020).
    - Full-width characters in the range U+FF01 to U+FF5E are converted to their half-width
      equivalents by subtracting 0xFEE0 from their Unicode code points.
    - Characters outside these ranges remain unchanged.
