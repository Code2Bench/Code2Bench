"""Extracts a table from a list of strings starting at a specified index.

This function processes a list of strings to identify and extract a table structure. The table is expected to be in a markdown-like format, where columns are separated by '|' and headers are optionally followed by a separator line. The function returns the extracted table as a dictionary containing headers and rows, along with the number of lines consumed.

Args:
    content (List[str]): A list of strings representing the content from which to extract the table.
    start_idx (int): The index in `content` from which to start searching for the table.

Returns:
    Tuple[Optional[Dict[str, Any]], int]: A tuple containing:
        - A dictionary with keys 'headers' (list of header strings) and 'rows' (list of row lists), or None if no valid table is found.
        - An integer indicating the number of lines consumed from `content`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Checks if `start_idx` is within the bounds of `content`. If not, returns `None` and 0.
2. Collects consecutive lines that contain '|' and are not empty, starting from `start_idx`.
3. Validates that at least two lines are collected to form a table.
4. Extracts headers from the first line.
5. Skips the separator line if present.
6. Extracts data rows, ensuring each row has the same number of cells as headers.
7. Returns the table structure and the number of lines consumed.

Edge Cases:
    - If `start_idx` is out of bounds, returns `None` and 0.
    - If fewer than two lines are collected, returns `None` and 1.
    - If no valid headers or rows are found, returns `None` and the number of lines consumed.

You should write code starting with:
