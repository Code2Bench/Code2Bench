"""Calculates the best pass rate at 1 for a given set of query results.

This function evaluates the pass rate for each round (round1, round2, round3) across all queries and returns the highest pass rate as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.

Args:
    query_results (Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]): A dictionary where each key is a query identifier and the value is another dictionary. The inner dictionary maps round names ("round1", "round2", "round3") to their respective results ("Correct" or "Incorrect").

Returns:
    float: The highest pass rate among the three rounds, expressed as a percentage and rounded to two decimal places.

The function works as follows:
1. Initializes a dictionary `round_correct` to count the number of "Correct" results for each round.
2. Iterates over each query and its results, updating the count of "Correct" results for each round.
3. Calculates the pass rate for each round by dividing the count of "Correct" results by the total number of queries.
4. Determines the highest pass rate among the three rounds.
5. Returns the highest pass rate as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.
"""
You should write code starting with:
from typing import Dict

def calculate_best_pass_at_1(query_results: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]) -> float:
    pass
