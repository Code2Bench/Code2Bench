"""Split continuous reference tags into individual reference tags.

This function processes a string containing reference tags and splits continuous references into individual tags. 
For example, it converts patterns like '[1:92ff35fb, 4:bfe6f044]' to '[1:92ff35fb][4:bfe6f044]'. 

The function only processes the text if the following conditions are met:
1. The character '[' appears exactly once.
2. The character ']' appears exactly once.
3. There are commas between the '[' and ']' characters.

If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns the original text unchanged.

Args:
    text (str): The text containing reference tags to be processed.

Returns:
    str: The text with split reference tags if conditions are met; otherwise, the original text.
