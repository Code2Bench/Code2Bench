"""Builds a list of buckets with increasing powers of 10 multiplied by mantissa values.

This function generates a list of values by multiplying each mantissa in `mantissa_lst` by increasing powers of 10 (starting from 10^0). The process continues until the generated value exceeds `max_value`. The resulting list of values is returned in ascending order.

Args:
    mantissa_lst (list[int]): A list of integer mantissa values to be multiplied by powers of 10.
    max_value (int): The maximum value allowed in the resulting bucket list. The function stops generating values once this limit is exceeded.

Returns:
    list[int]: A list of integer values representing the buckets, sorted in ascending order.

Note:
    The function ensures that all generated values are less than or equal to `max_value`. If a value exceeds `max_value`, it is not included in the result, and the function terminates.
