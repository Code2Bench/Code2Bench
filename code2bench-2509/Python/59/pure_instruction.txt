"""Checks whether a device with a given compute capability supports a specified thread block cluster shape.

This function validates the thread block cluster shape based on the compute capability (CC) of the device. 
For devices with CC less than 90, the cluster shape must be [1, 1, 1]. For devices with CC 90 or higher, 
the cluster shape must be rank-3, with the third dimension being 1, and the product of the first two 
dimensions must not exceed 8 thread blocks.

Args:
    cc (int): Compute capability of the device in question.
    cluster_shape (list): Dimensions of the thread block cluster shape to check.

Returns:
    tuple: A tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the cluster shape is valid 
           for the device, and the second element is an error message (empty string if valid).

Raises:
    None: This function does not raise any exceptions but returns an error message in the tuple.

Examples:
    >>> valid_cluster_shape(89, [1, 1, 1])
    (True, '')
    >>> valid_cluster_shape(90, [1, 1, 1])
    (True, '')
    >>> valid_cluster_shape(90, [4, 2, 1])
    (True, '')
