"""Filters a list of bounding boxes by removing any box that is fully contained within another.

This function iterates through all pairs of bounding boxes and checks if one box is entirely
contained within another. If a box is found to be contained, it is marked for removal. The
function returns a new list of bounding boxes excluding those that were marked for removal.

Args:
    bboxes (List[Dict[str, int]]): A list of bounding boxes. Each bounding box is represented
                                   as a dictionary with the following keys:
                                   - 'column_min': The minimum column index of the box.
                                   - 'row_min': The minimum row index of the box.
                                   - 'column_max': The maximum column index of the box.
                                   - 'row_max': The maximum row index of the box.

Returns:
    List[Dict[str, int]]: A new list of bounding boxes with the smaller, contained boxes removed.

Note:
    - If two bounding boxes are identical, one of them will be removed to de-duplicate the list.
    - The function uses a set to store indices of boxes to be removed, ensuring efficient
      membership checking and avoiding duplicates.
