"""Clean DDL statements for PGlite compatibility.

This function processes Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to make them compatible with PGlite by removing or replacing PostgreSQL-specific features that PGlite does not support. The function performs the following transformations:

1. Replaces vector column types with TEXT.
2. Removes GIN indexes.
3. Simplifies constraint names by removing the 'CONSTRAINT' keyword.
4. Removes PostgreSQL-specific column constraints like '::text'.
5. Converts TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE to TIMESTAMP.
6. Replaces SERIAL and BIGSERIAL types with INTEGER.

Additionally, the function filters out lines containing unsupported PostgreSQL features such as GIN, GIST, TSVECTOR, TO_TSVECTOR, PG_TRGM, BTREE_GIN, and BTREE_GIST.

Args:
    ddl (str): The DDL statement to be cleaned.

Returns:
    str: The cleaned DDL statement compatible with PGlite.
