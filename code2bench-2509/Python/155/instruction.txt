"""Extracts the 'Examples:' section from a Google-style docstring.

This function parses a given docstring to locate and extract the 'Examples:' section. It is designed to handle
docstrings formatted according to the Google Python Style Guide. The function returns the extracted section as a
single string, preserving the original formatting and indentation.

Args:
    docstring (Optional[str]): The full docstring of a function. If None or empty, the function returns None.

Returns:
    Optional[str]: The extracted examples section as a string, or None if the 'Examples:' section is not found.

The function identifies the 'Examples:' section by searching for a line that starts with 'Examples:'. It continues
to collect lines until it encounters a new section (indicated by a line that starts with a non-space character and
ends with a colon) or reaches the end of the docstring. The collected lines are then joined into a single string
and returned.
"""
You should write code starting with:
from typing import Optional

def extract_examples_section(docstring: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    # TODO: Implement this function based on the docstring.
    pass
