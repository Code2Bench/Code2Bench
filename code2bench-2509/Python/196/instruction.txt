"""Generates a transition sentence based on the content of the previous text and the current heading.

This function analyzes the last 240 characters of the previous text to determine the context and constructs a transition sentence that smoothly introduces the current heading. The transition sentence is chosen based on the presence of specific keywords in the previous text.

Args:
    previous_text (str): The text that precedes the current heading. Only the last 240 characters are considered for analysis.
    current_heading (str): The heading that the transition sentence will introduce.

Returns:
    str: A transition sentence that connects the previous text to the current heading. The sentence is constructed based on the presence of specific keywords in the previous text:
        - If the previous text contains any of the words "problem", "issue", or "challenge", the transition sentence will focus on identifying challenges and exploring solutions.
        - If the previous text contains any of the words "solution", "approach", or "method", the transition sentence will build on the approach and introduce the next step.
        - If the previous text contains any of the words "important", "crucial", or "essential", the transition sentence will emphasize the importance and introduce the next focus area.
        - If none of the above keywords are found, a generic transition sentence is used to lead into the current heading.
