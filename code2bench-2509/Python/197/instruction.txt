"""Determines if a given gap description is of high quality based on specific criteria.

This function evaluates a gap description by applying a series of checks to ensure it meets
quality standards. The criteria include the length of the description, the presence of generic
terms, and the meaningfulness of the content.

Args:
    gap (str): The gap description to be evaluated. Leading and trailing whitespace is removed
               before processing.

Returns:
    bool: True if the gap description is considered high quality, False otherwise.

The function performs the following checks in sequence:
1. Length Check: The description must be at least 10 characters long after stripping whitespace.
2. Generic Gap Check: The description must not be a generic term (e.g., 'general', 'overview').
3. Meaningful Content Check: The description must contain at least three words.

Examples:
    >>> _is_gap_high_quality('meaningful gap analysis')
    True
    >>> _is_gap_high_quality('detailed analysis of the gap in the market')
    True
    >>> _is_gap_high_quality('general')
    False
    >>> _is_gap_high_quality('short')
    False
"""
You should write code starting with:
def _is_gap_high_quality(gap: str) -> bool:
    pass
